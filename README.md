# Font-Changer-using-only-HTML-and-CSS
Without JavaScript I made a project which to necessitate use of JavaScript only using HTML and CSS.

I had to make a site with 5 buttons under a header.
Under the 5 buttons, there were two paragraphs.
Every button click would have changed the font properties of the paragraph below.
One of the font properties to be necessarily was Font-family.
The Font family was to be import via external files.
The other necessary font property to be changed was Font-size.
